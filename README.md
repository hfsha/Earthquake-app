## üìä Abstract

This project presents an interactive web-based dashboard for analyzing global earthquake data from 1995 to 2023, featuring advanced visualizations and machine learning for tsunami risk prediction. Leveraging comprehensive datasets from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the platform offers real-time filtering, geographic heatmaps, statistical correlations, anomaly detection, and a robust machine learning pipeline (XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) achieving up to 94.2% accuracy in tsunami risk prediction. Designed for emergency responders, researchers, policy makers, and the public, the dashboard combines exploratory data analysis with predictive modeling in a user-friendly, visually engaging interface.

## üîé Introduction

Earthquakes are among the most devastating natural disasters, impacting millions and causing significant losses worldwide. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, for example, triggered a catastrophic tsunami and highlighted the urgent need for advanced seismic monitoring and prediction systems. Despite progress in seismology, real-time data access, spatial analysis, and predictive modeling for secondary hazards like tsunamis remain challenging.

This project addresses these gaps by providing a comprehensive analytics platform that merges interactive data visualization with machine learning-based tsunami risk prediction, empowering users to explore, analyze, and anticipate seismic risks globally.

## üåü Interesting Findings

1. **Pacific Ring of Fire:** Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Japan are the most earthquake-prone, consistent with global seismic data.
2. **Magnitude, Depth, and Tsunami Risk:** Shallow, high-magnitude quakes are most likely to trigger tsunamis; most events occur at depths <80 km.
3. **Anomalies & Outliers:** Rare, extreme events (e.g., 2011 Tohoku, 2004 Sumatra) drive the majority of fatalities and economic losses.
